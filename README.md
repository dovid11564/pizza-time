This is Pizza Time (name still in development), a passion project of mine to share my love of pizza with the world. 

When this site is done, you will be able to view all pizza places that I have rated, view their locations off of a map, filter through different pizza places by different criteria, etc. 

What I am currently working on:

 - Creating and organizing my database </br>
 - Inplimenting User Auth and different account types

What's next?

- Implimenting a form that allows admins to create new reviews and post them to the backend
